Chapter 9

Smithers drives me in his unmarked car the short distance to Auckland Central Police Station, which is a 70s tower block. He takes me to an interview room and introduces me to a young detective constable, Cheryl something, who sits in on the interview, which is recorded. Smithers does all the questioning and Cheryl just looks at me carefully. He quickly acknowledges that we have met before when he used to be based at the Counties-Manukau station and was investigating the murder of Sammy Becker-Lau. But, without dwelling on that, he proceeds to ask a series of methodical questions. Why was I there? How did I find the body? Did I test for signs of life? Was I surprised it was not Merrick? Why did I think the death, as it turned out to be, was suspicious? They seem to be suspicious of me but I like the structure the questions give to the interview. I don’t have to try to think what to include.

When Smithers asks about how the body appeared I remember I had taken some photographs. He says he did too but mine could be useful. I open my phone and find the photos. He asks if they can download them and I just hand over my phone. Cheryl takes it away after Smithers notes her departure for the recording. I think, should I be handing over my unlocked phone like that? I am a very trusting secret agent! Well, it’s only my personal phone. Smithers carries on in his methodical manner and after a little while Cheryl returns and says I have a phone call from someone called ‘Maria’, who is very insistent on speaking to me. 

“Do you mind if I take this quickly?”

“OK, if it is important.”

“Hello, Maria. Sorry I didn’t let you know where I’ll be.”  “Who was that?” Maria asks.

“That was a detective constable who was downloading some photos I took of the body”

“Are you at Auckland Central Police Station?”

“Yes I am. I am being interviewed now.”

“I can be there in about 15 minutes.”

“Good. See you soon.”

Smithers and Cheryl are looking at me strangely.

“Who is Maria and how does she know anything about a body?” Smithers asks.

“She is a friend who has just flown in from Wellington. I was going to meet her. She phoned me before you arrived and I explained that I might be delayed and briefly why.”

“We need to be discreet at the beginning of an investigation. She won’t contact the press, will she?”

“Oh no, she is perfectly discreet,” I say, thinking how impressively careful she is in everything she says and does. “You can meet her. She will be here in a quarter of an hour.”

Smithers and Cheryl glance at each other. Smithers pauses for a moment and then says deliberately, “Yes. we would like that.” 

The questioning then takes a new tack. “Were you upset when you saw the body? You suggested you were pretty sure he was dead from the beginning.”

“I was probably more surprised than upset. It is never pleasant to see a corpse but I have been in worse situations.”

Smithers briefly explains to Cheryl how I had been caught up in the aftermath of Sammy’s death and had been assaulted. “You seem to attract suspicious deaths!” he says that lightly but I feel they are sizing me up.

They carry on the interview in a less directed way, asking about my background and the nature of the research that led me to set up the meeting with Professor Merrick. Cheryl is now asking most of the questions.  She has a softer style but, in a way, is probably more searching. I think I bluffed my way through her  question about my research topic  even though in reality it was a pretty thin pretext.

I am grateful when a young, uniformed constable knocks on the door and says someone needs to see Smithers immediately. Cheryl suspends the interview, turning off the recording. Then she carries on chatting with me and asks about Finland. I also talk about my time in America. She asks about gender studies. Perhaps I can recruit her as a part-time student.

Eventually Smithers returns and says he has been speaking with Maria who has put him in the picture. Cheryl gives him a look as if to say, “I hope you put me  in the picture.”  He says I am free to go with Maria and they will contact me if they need anything more.

Maria books a cab, which arrives promptly, and takes us to her hotel which is the Grand Chancellor. We go up to her room. We sit on the bed for a moment and Maria gives me a careful and considerate hug. It brings home how much I am under stress even though I think I have been handling it pretty well. 

“We have lots to talk about but for now we need to have some dinner. I know a very nice seafood restaurant a short walk from here,” Maria says.

Maria takes the opportunity to show me where some of the competitors for the America’s Cup yacht races were based in 2003.

The dinner is very pleasant. Maria talks cautiously even though we are probably not going to be overheard.

“I told your interviewer who I am and said you are trustworthy. He is going to update me about new developments. Are you busy tomorrow? It would be good to chat some more.”

“I am seeing someone late morning and also have a meeting in the afternoon,” I reply.

“Can you stay over tonight?” she asks with a flirtatious smile.

“Sure,” I reply after what I hope is not too significant a pause. I hadn’t expected that and wasn’t sure whether this is mostly business or mostly pleasure. We continue to chat idly and I feel myself starting to relax. We walk back to the hotel in a companionable manner.

When we get back to the room Maria carefully takes my head in her hands and kisses me softly on the lips. We lie on the bed in each other’s arms and talk over the events of the day while her hands stroke me lightly. It suddenly occurs to me to mention that Suu Maung was there at the university when I found the body. 

Maria freezes and says, “Was she really? Sorry but I need to call this in.” She gets up and moves away from the bed. She calls someone immediately, within my earshot but pulling away into a professional bubble.
