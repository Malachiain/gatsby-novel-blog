Chapter 8

It is Wednesday afternoon, the day Maria is coming up from Wellington. I was able to arrange an appointment to meet Professor Merrick at 2 pm. My cover was that I am investigating  women in various professions cross-nationally including between the USA and Aotearoa-New Zealand. I made a point of including ‘Aotearoa’ in the name of the country in order to live up to an image of a Gender Studies Professor. Oh, I am not *pretending* to be a Professor of Gender Studies, or am I? I do occasionally succumb to imposter syndrome. Anyway, maybe now I am really a SIS operative and the academic role is my cover. 

I take the train from Papatoetoe into Central Auckland, about half an hour. You have to walk up a fairly steep hill to reach the University of Auckland and the weather is warm but it is good exercise. I make my way through the campus to the far end where the modern science building are located. I thought I had plenty of time before my appointment but in fact I find my way to Merrick’s office right on the time we have our appointment. I knock on the door. There is no answer. I knock again and there is total silence within. No talking, no sound of typing. I wait for a few minutes, thinking he might return to his office any moment. Or perhaps he is taking a nap. I knock a third time and out of frustration I try the door. The desk is directly opposite the door and sitting in the chair and slumped right over the desk is a man, presumably Professor Peter Eldon Merrick III.

A chill comes over me and I am transfixed for what seems like an age. I pull myself together and approach him to see if he has a pulse. I press my fingers to his neck and can't find one but maybe I am not quite in the right spot. He feels warm. He is face down on the desk so it is not easy to check if he is breathing but he doesn’t appear to be. I get out my phone and dial the emergency number 111. Just as it is ringing someone appears at the open door and gives a short high pitched scream. It is Suu Maung. I give her a wave of acknowledgement and ask the emergency operator for an Ambulance. 

“There is a man here slumped over his desk. I can’t find a pulse. I need an ambulance quickly. I am at the University of Auckland, Science Building 301, Symonds Street. My name? Inka Makonnen. M, A, K, O, double N, E, N. Yes, I will see if someone will guide you to the room. Yes, they can call me back on this number.”

I turn to Suu Maung. “Do you know where the nearest administrator’s office is?”

Suu has composed herself and replies, “I think there was one down this way and to the right.”

We reach a faculty administrator’s office with an open door, bearing the name ‘Mary Tyler’ and there is a competent looking woman typing on a keyboard. I burst in.

“Professor Merrick is slumped over his desk. I have called for an ambulance. They may need help getting to the room.”

Mary just asks what address I gave, which I tell her. She is on the phone immediately to someone who can lead the paramedics to the right office. During that phone call, Suu Maung touches me on the arm. 

“I am very sorry but I really need to leave you now. Will you be alright?”

“Yes, I’ll be fine. Don’t worry. We’ll be in touch.”

Mary asks me to go with her to Merrick’s room. While she seems very calm, I think she needs the support. We quickly reach the room. In our haste, Suu Maung and I had left the door open and the body, for in my heart of hearts I assume he is dead, is in full view. The corridor is empty, though, and I assume no-one else saw him. 

Mary shocks me by saying, “That’s not Professor Merrick! I don’t recognise this man at all.”

“Oh! I had an appointment with Professor Merrick but I had never met him before.”

In fact, I had seen a photo of him on the website but didn’t study it carefully, and the face down sight of a slightly balding sandy coloured hair man didn’t contain anything to shake my natural assumption that the man in Merrick’s office was indeed Marrick. 

Mary seems a little relieved as well as puzzled. She makes no attempt to check for vital signs. I half think we should be attempting vigorous resuscitation but I don’t say anything as I think it is futile. 

“I think I should phone the police, I say, unless you would prefer to,” I say.

“Oh, the police? Yes, I suppose so. No. You go ahead, but you can give me as the university contact. Mary Tyler, extension 8752.” 

I carefully close the door this time and we walk back to Mary’s office. 

“Let me find the number for Auckland Central Police Station for you,” she offers, and quickly finds it.

I walk half into the corridor to make my call and I hear Mary also calling someone, very likely her supervisor. It seems to take me a while to explain to the police switchboard operator the nature of the situation but then he decides to put me through to Detective Sergeant Smithers, to whom I repeat my explanation, including Mary’s name and extension number. He is economical with his words but to the point. He clearly thinks there is a potential crime scene.

“Have the ambulance paramedics arrived?”

“No. I only called for an ambulance a few minutes ago.”

“Has anyone touched anything?”

“I tried to find a pulse, unsuccessfully.”

“What I want you to do is take photographs from all angles but don’t touch anything more. I will call you back in a few minutes.”

I do as requested and indeed he does call me back. He says he would need to speak with me. I agree, saying sooner rather than later as I live in South Auckland. He asks me to stay at the University and asks me, or Mary, to let him know  when the paramedics arrive on the number he is phoning from. My guess is he wants to first see if the man is truly dead. I take the opportunity to phone Maria. She says she has just landed at Auckland Airport. Thinking in terms of the security of the line, I choose my words carefully. 

“Look, something really strange has come up. At the University of Auckland I have just found someone slumped over his desk.”

“Dead?”

“Could well be. I hope to see you later but I don’t know how long I will be caught up in it all. We are just waiting for the ambulance and the police.”

There is a meaningful silence at the end of the phone. It is not often you take Maria by surprise but this is such a moment. She just says,

“OK, text me to say where you are going and I will join you when I can.”

I think I can read between the lines.

The paramedics show up with a trolley, or a gurney, as Americans say, and spend some time in Merrick’s office. I give Smithers a call, which he doesn’t answer but a couple of minutes later he arrives. He obviously had developed a more urgent interest in the matter. He goes into Merrick’s room and spends some time there. Eventually the paramedics emerge with the trolley with the body, for that is surely what we can now call it, completely covered.

“Dead?” I ask.

Smithers just nods. He says he would need to have a few words with Mary, which seemed to take about ten minutes, and then he would like me to accompany him to the Police Station.
