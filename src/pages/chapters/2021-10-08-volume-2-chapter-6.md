It is Wednesday afternoon. I find my way to the venue for the ‘Women in Accountancy Panel Discussion’. It is a room in the main building  I haven’t seen before, a smallish lecture theatre with slightly raked seating.  As I go in, there is a small group of women talking down the front. It is clear from her features and clothing which ois Suu Maung. She is short and slight and is wearing an elegant long skirt with a blue pattern and a tight white blouse with three quarter length sleeves. She has long dark hair pinned to clear her face. The chair goes to the lectern and brings the meeting to order. The attendance seems a bit thin. There are a number of young women there, some in jeans and some more formally dressed. There are a couple of middle-aged men, Accountancy lecturers I assume. I know no-one in the room.

The chair introduces one of the speakers from a local firm of accountants whose name is composed of the names of three principals, very likely all men. Clothed in a grey pin-stripe business suit, she describes her entry into the profession and talks about the need for persistence and self-confidence in what is largely a male dominated enterprise. She goes in some detail into the varying characteristics of the different branches of Accountancy. She emphasises how, once you have established yourself in a particular niche, you can achieve respect on the basis of the quality of your work. 

The second speaker is a little older and also talks about herself to some extent but adopts a lighter, cheerier tone encouraging the young women present to join the growing number of women in the profession. Suu Maung, bringing up the rear, speaks more quietly than the other two, though she articulates her words clearly. She has less to say about the profession in New Zealand, naturally enough, but contributes some useful international statistics.

We move into the discussion phase. There aren’t too many questions and comments but there is a very pointed question from one young woman about whether young female accountants are subject to sexual harassment, intimidation or assault by older, male colleagues. She mentions the ‘me too’ movement. It is interesting to see the three speakers dance around that topic. They each say, in their different styles, that they have not personally suffered harassment in an extreme form without denying the potential. I feel sympathetic for them. Although I had not intended to contribute, I feel I can help. I say that this is an important issue that concerns many professions and spheres of society in many parts of the world. I am able to reference accusations against the Hollywood mogul, Harvey Weinstein, that are in the news. 

“This is a meeting to encourage the growth of women in the profession of accounting. Our speakers cannot provide a cast iron guarantee against harassment but it is still important to encourage women to take their place in the profession. It is up to all women, however junior in their firm, not to put up with that kind of behaviour and speak out. The tide is turning so that those who speak out are likely to be supported.”

I fear I may be changing the tone of the meeting, but the speakers seem pleased and reiterate what I have said in softer ways. The questioner seems satisfied too. I am pleased I am here and can bring in a gender studies perspective, even if it is a pretty straightforward one. The meeting closes and I move to the front of the room and introduce myself to Suu Maung. She makes sure I meet the other speakers and the chair. 

“I hope I didn’t disturb the arc of the meeting by what I said.”

“No, not at all,” the first of the speakers says. “That was very helpful. There are ‘me too’ issues in many businesses and professions but not especially in accounting.” The others nod in agreement. 

I realise that Suu needs to help look after the other speakers so I suggest to her that we meet later in the week and that I will email her. I think that seems natural. I really want to talk to her one to one.

I return to my office only to find Jason waiting for me. I am not particularly pleased to see him but I am struck by a certain link between the ‘me too’ issues that had been raised in the panel discussion and the curious dynamics of the Jason, Matilda, McDuff triangle. If McDuff had invited Matilda to his house to discuss an essay he was going to mark and then encouraged sex, well that, morally, would be an open and shut case and regrettably not a rare one. Even as it was, there is plenty of blame to go around but, knowing the participants, I can see their failings with some sympathy.

I usher Jason into my office. This time he is more articulate. 

“I am sorry I didn’t know what to say last time I came to see you. I was in such a knot about it all and still am. I don’t have anyone else I can talk to about it.”

“That’s alright. I don’t know how much I can help but I can listen and share my thoughts.”

“You know I regret making the complaint against McDuff even though he was an idiot.”

“He certainly was. I can understand you regretting taking that action and maybe feeling bad about it. Even so, you reacted to the situation rather than initiating it. Try and look at what you did as if from the outside. You felt betrayed, the situation was all wrong and you responded to it. Accept responsibility for your role in the whole business but then move on.”

“Have you seen Matilda?” Jason asks.

“No.” 

“I am sure she is in town. I caught sight of her again.”

“I expect I will see her in the next few days. But I don’t want to be a mediator between the two of you,” I add, to lower expectations

Jason agrees and, shortly afterwards, leaves. Maybe he will come and see me again about this but I don’t feel as bad about that as I did last time.
