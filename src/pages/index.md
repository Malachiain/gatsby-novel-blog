  title: Invitation to read
  description: >
    My novel, actually a novella it turns out, finishes at chapter 25.  I shall
    leave it up here for a month or two, but do plan in the meantime to work on
    revisions.  I want to work on the language, particularly the dialogue,
    trying to make it more appropriate to the characters.  I shall also be
    looking at timelines more carefully and shall generally try to eliminate any
    plot inconsistencies.  I would welcome any comments, especially about
    particular places where you think a correction or improvement is in order.
    Just email me at davidlumsden49@gmail.com. Thank you for reading.  I wonder
    what happens next to Inka.
