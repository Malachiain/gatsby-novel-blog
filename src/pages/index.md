  title: Invitation to read
  description: >
    Would you like to read chapters of my novel (in draft form) roughly as I
    write them? Each week I shall post a new chapter or two.  The chapters are
    very short. I hope you will be entertained. I am happy to receive comments,
    such as about something I have got wrong. Just email me at
    davidlumsden49@gmail.com but please don't feel obliged to comment if you
    don't want to.
